# VeinTessellation

This project aims at studying the spatial geometry of veination network of plant.

- For analysis of Voronoi property of Pilea leaves, see files contained in `pilea_Voronoi_test`.

- For analysis of cleared leaf samples in different environmental conditions, see files contained in `pilea_cleared_leaves`.

- For graphical model of vein formation, see `dart_throwing_algo`.

- For flow optimization model, see `transport_optimization`.
